# Knowledge Graph

[GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) is the guiding schema for depicting the relationship in XML

## Fundamental Questions
1. Why do we need knowledge graphs (KG) ?
    - We need this to express complex relationships elegantly.They are hard to express clearly in words because of the complexity. 
    - [Detailed discussion on Knowledge Graph and documentation](#detailed-discussion-on-knowledge-graph-and-documentation) has much more details on this.
1. But we already know this - why do we need to put in extra effort and express it here ?
    - Think!! Unless we externalize this knowledge, we will be called routinely to solve the same problem again and again. And that starts to be wastage of our time.
1. But is that not already covered in our documentation ?
    - No! As mentioned earlier, we tend to avoid these generally. 
    - If they were already there -- all troubleshooting could be solved from our documentation.
    - And even for arguements sake, let us assume we try to extract KG from the documents. We can use existing `NLP models` to help us. We will see that these extracted KG will be dirty and incomplete. They will be need to be reviewed by developers and cleansed and more information added. It will be huge expenditure of time and resources.

## To run:
1. `git clone` this repo.
1. Put your xml file describing the relationship in `knowledge-graph/input` dir. This currently has 2 samples to test out the process.
1. ```cd knowledge-graph```
1. ```python src/main.py```
1. This will create the graphs in knowledge-graph/output dir
1. Where will these be uploaded/saved?

|Category|Knowledge Graphs|Documentation|
|---|---|---|
|Semantic Relationships|Capture semantic relationships between entities. They represent not just the information itself but also the relationships between different pieces of information. This allows for a more nuanced and context-aware understanding.|Often presents information in a linear or hierarchical fashion, lacking the ability to represent complex semantic connections between different concepts.|
|Flexibility and Scalability|Are flexible and can accommodate new information and relationships easily. They scale well as the amount of information grows, providing a dynamic and adaptable structure.|May become cumbersome and less flexible as the volume of information increases. Maintaining and updating documentation can be time-consuming.
Facilitates Discovery and Exploration|Facilitate exploration and discovery by allowing users to traverse relationships and uncover hidden connections between entities. This interactive exploration can lead to new insights.|Requires users to follow a predefined structure, and discovering non-linear relationships can be challenging.|
|Machine Reasoning and Inference|Enable machine reasoning and inference. Algorithms can traverse the graph, infer new relationships, and make logical deductions based on the existing knowledge.|Primarily relies on human interpretation, and automated reasoning is limited.|
|Natural Language Understanding|Can be used to enhance natural language understanding by providing a structured representation of concepts and their relationships. This is particularly valuable for applications like chatbots and virtual assistants|Relies on users to interpret and understand information in natural language without the benefit of explicit semantic connections.|

*In summary, knowledge graphs provide a richer, more interconnected representation of information compared to traditional documentation. They excel in capturing complex relationships, supporting scalability, and enabling both human and machine understanding of knowledge.*
