## üìä Sample Analytics Queries

The repository includes 50+ ready-to-use queries in `knowledge-graph/sample_queries.cypher` for comprehensive graph analysis including Application Lifecycle model intelligence:

### Key Query Categories
- **Basic Analysis**: Component distribution, graph statistics, connectivity patterns
- **Cross-Subsystem Analysis**: Integration patterns, dependency flows
- **Hub-Spoke Architecture**: Cross-cluster communication and deployment patterns  
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Root components, dependency chains, bottlenecks
- **Enterprise Features**: Addons, Global Hub, Submariner networking
- **Operational Queries**: Operators, controllers, APIs
- **Troubleshooting**: Component search, neighborhood analysis
- **Application Lifecycle Models**: Subscription, ArgoCD Push, and ArgoCD Pull deployment patterns

### Example Queries
```cypher
// Most Connected Components (Hub Analysis)
MATCH (n:RHACMComponent)
OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r_out]->()
OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r_in]->(n)
RETURN n.label as Component, n.subsystem as Subsystem,
       count(DISTINCT r_out) + count(DISTINCT r_in) as TotalConnections
ORDER BY TotalConnections DESC LIMIT 10;

// Cross-Subsystem Integration Matrix
MATCH (source:RHACMComponent)-[r]->(target:RHACMComponent)
WHERE source.subsystem <> target.subsystem
RETURN source.subsystem as SourceSubsystem, 
       target.subsystem as TargetSubsystem,

- [open-cluster-management-io](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io) - OCM foundation
- [Red Hat official documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Generate New Architecture
```bash
# Convert Mermaid files to Cypher
python mermaid_to_cypher.py

# Import to Neo4j
cat knowledge-graph/rhacm_architecture_comprehensive_final.cypher | cypher-shell

# Run sample analytics queries
cat knowledge-graph/sample_queries.cypher | cypher-shell
```

### Add New Components
1. Update relevant `mermaid/rhacm-*.mmd` file with semantic relationships
2. Run conversion tool to generate updated Cypher
3. Update documentation with new metrics

### Enhanced Observability Implementation
For reproducing the enhanced observability architecture:

#### 1. Source Diagrams Required
Ensure you have these observability diagrams in `diagrams/` folder:
- `rhacm_observability_components_architecture.png`
- `rhacm_observability_bootstrapping_hub.png` 
- `rhacm_observability_bootstrapping_managed.png`
- `rhacm_observability_metrics_collection_alert_forwarding.png`
- `rhacm_observability_status_propagation.png`

#### 2. Key Enhancement Areas
- **Component Separation**: Separate combined components (e.g., "metrics collector/uwl metrics collector" ‚Üí separate components)
- **Bootstrap Sequences**: Map exact hub and managed cluster bootstrap flows from diagrams
- **Metrics Collection**: Detailed data flows from exporters through Prometheus to Thanos
- **Status Propagation**: Cross-cluster status synchronization patterns
- **External Integrations**: Victoria Metrics, Kafka, and third-party tool export paths

#### 3. Critical Implementation Notes
- **No Combined Components**: Each component from diagrams must be separate (avoid "component1/component2" naming)
- **Exact Component Names**: Match casing and spacing from PNG diagrams exactly (e.g., "MultiCluster Observability Operator")
- **Bootstrap Flow Accuracy**: Follow precise creation sequences shown in bootstrap diagrams
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensure no duplicate components (e.g., multiple THANOS entries)

#### 4. Validation Process
1. Cross-reference each PNG diagram component-by-component against mermaid file
2. Verify all relationship flows match diagram arrows
3. Confirm no missing components from any diagram
4. Test that component names match exactly (including casing)
5. **Resolve duplicate labels** by adding disambiguating suffixes (e.g., "Component (Context)")
6. **Validate Neo4j syntax** by ensuring relationship labels don't contain parentheses or problematic spaces
   - Transform `create (loop for all...)` ‚Üí `create_for_managed_clusters`
   - Transform `send metrics (remote write API)` ‚Üí `send_metrics_remote_write`
   - Transform `forward metrics (if configured)` ‚Üí `forward_metrics_if_configured`
   - Transform `scrape metrics` ‚Üí `scrape_metrics`
   - Transform `forward alerts` ‚Üí `forward_alerts`
   - Transform `update status` ‚Üí `update_status`
