# RHACM Architecture Dependency Graph

A comprehensive Neo4j dependency graph of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) architecture across all major subsystems.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This repository contains the most complete dependency graph of RHACM architecture, verified against official GitHub repositories and enhanced with internal component analysis.

### Key Features
- **Complete Component Coverage** across 7 subsystems (Overview, Governance, Application, Observability, Cluster, Search, Console)
- **Semantic Relationships** (DEPENDS_ON, CONTAINS, MANAGES, etc.)
- **Full Addon Coverage** - All RHACM addons included
- **Hub-Spoke Architecture** with cross-cluster deployment patterns
- **Enterprise Components** - MCE, Global Hub, Submariner, Backup/Recovery, CAPI, Red Hat Insights

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Import to Neo4j
```bash
# Clear existing data (optional)
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;

# Import the complete architecture
# Copy and run knowledge-graph/rhacm_architecture_comprehensive_final.cypher in Neo4j Browser
```

### 2. Verify Import
```cypher
// Component count by subsystem
MATCH (n:RHACMComponent) 
RETURN n.subsystem as Subsystem, count(n) as ComponentCount 
ORDER BY ComponentCount DESC;

// Verify all components imported successfully
```

### 3. Explore with Sample Queries
```cypher
// Copy and run queries from knowledge-graph/sample_queries.cypher
// 30+ analytics queries for comprehensive graph exploration
```

## üìä Sample Analytics Queries

The repository includes 30+ ready-to-use queries in `knowledge-graph/sample_queries.cypher` for comprehensive graph analysis:

### Key Query Categories
- **Basic Analysis**: Component distribution, graph statistics, connectivity patterns
- **Cross-Subsystem Analysis**: Integration patterns, dependency flows
- **Hub-Spoke Architecture**: Cross-cluster communication and deployment patterns  
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Root components, dependency chains, bottlenecks
- **Enterprise Features**: Addons, Global Hub, Submariner networking
- **Operational Queries**: Operators, controllers, APIs
- **Troubleshooting**: Component search, neighborhood analysis

### Example Queries
```cypher
// Most Connected Components (Hub Analysis)
MATCH (n:RHACMComponent)
OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r_out]->()
OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r_in]->(n)
RETURN n.label as Component, n.subsystem as Subsystem,
       count(DISTINCT r_out) + count(DISTINCT r_in) as TotalConnections
ORDER BY TotalConnections DESC LIMIT 10;

// Cross-Subsystem Integration Matrix
MATCH (source:RHACMComponent)-[r]->(target:RHACMComponent)
WHERE source.subsystem <> target.subsystem
RETURN source.subsystem as SourceSubsystem, 
       target.subsystem as TargetSubsystem,
       count(r) as Dependencies
ORDER BY Dependencies DESC;
```
